  <title>Bootstrapping</title>

  <para>We already discussed in <xref linkend="section-validator-instance" />
  how to create a <classname>Validator</classname> instance using the
  different methods in <classname>javax.validation.Validation</classname>. In
  this chapter we will discuss the underlying mechanisms and have a closer
  look at the different configuration possibilties available via the
  <classname>Configuration</classname> object.</para>

  <section>
    <title><classname>MessageInterpolator</classname></title>

    <para>The message interpolator is provided to the ValidatorFactory at
    construction time using Configuration.messageInterpolator(). This message
    interpolator is shared by all validators gener- ated by this
    ValidatorFactory. It is recommended that MessageInterpolator
    implementations delegate final interpolation to the Bean Validation
    default MessageInterpolator to ensure standard Bean Validation
    interpolation rules are followed. The default implementation is accessible
    through Configuration.getDefaultMessageInterpolator(). </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title><classname>TraversableResolver</classname></title>

    <para>The Bean Validation provider must not access the state of a
    property, nor validate its constraints if the property is not traversable.
    A property is traversable if TraversableResolver returns true for this
    property. </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title><classname>ConstraintValidatorFactory</classname></title>

    <para>The default ConstraintValidatorFactory provided by the Bean
    Validation provider implementation uses the pub- lic constraint no-arg
    constructor. A custom ConstraintValidatorFactory can be provided for
    example to benefit from dependency injection control in constraint
    implementations. Any constraint implementation relying on Con-
    straintValidatorFactory behaviors specific to an implementation
    (dependency injection, no no-arg constructor and so on) are not considered
    portable, hence great care should be given before walking that path.
    ConstraintValidatorFactory should not cache instances as the state of each
    instance can be altered in the ini- tialize method. </para>
