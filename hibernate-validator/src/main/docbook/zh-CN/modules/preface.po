"Validating data is a common task that occurs throughout any application, "
"from the presentation layer to the persistence layer. Often the same "
"validation logic is implemented in each layer, proving time consuming and "
"error-prone. To avoid duplication of these validations in each layer, "
"developers often bundle validation logic directly into the domain model, "
"cluttering domain classes with validation code which is really metadata "
"about the class itself."

"JSR 303 - Bean Validation - defines a metadata model and API for entity "
"validation. The default metadata source is annotations, with the ability to "
"override and extend the meta-data through the use of XML. The API is not "
"tied to a specific application tier or programming model. It is specifically "
"not tied to either the web tier or the persistence tier, and is available "
"for both server-side application programming, as well as rich client Swing "
"application developers."
